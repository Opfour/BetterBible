How to Contribute
=================

1. Use a plain text editor or edit here on GitHub.
2. If you are adding a new verse, indent it so that the numbering of the original verses doesn't change.
3. If you are removing a verse entirely, use `~~Original text.~~` to ~~strike through~~ the text, but leave its number there so the numbering of subsequent verses doesn't change.
4. Send a pull request for your changes.

Verse insertion example:

```markdown
1. Original verse 1
	1. Added verse between original 1 and original 2
2. Original verse 2
```
