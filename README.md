BetterBible
===========

*The Bible has some issues. Let's make it better.*

The Bible has been around for a long time. The King James Version, one of the most famous English translations, has been around for over 400 years. And yet very little has changed. Christianity has changed. Society has changed. Science has revealed much to us. But we're still stuck with the same old boring, inaccurate, archaic Bible.

Here are the goals of the BetterBible project:

1. **Fix errors** — Where the Bible makes obvious mistakes, let's fix them.
2. **Inject humor** — The Bible can be a dry read and could do with some humor.
3. **Modernize** — Make it something that we can relate to. Jesus didn't address a topic? Well in this version, he can.
4. **Blaspheme** — Because none of the above would be very fun if we didn't.

Current status:

*The book of Genesis is now open for pull requests*
